# Meta Object

Meta objects can be included in [addon](root.md) and [version](version.md) objects. 
They should be used to give information about the addon or the version, like a **name**,
a **description** or a **changelog**. The specification does not require a specific format
for meta objects, therefore you can add any property to it.
It is however recommended to follow conventions for it.
